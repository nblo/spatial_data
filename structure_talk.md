# In 1 hour around the world of spatial data 


## Slide 1 Why should I care? 
- Goals of the talk: basic understanding of geospatial data 
- Why is geospatial data important for utilities? 
- Have fun: understand memes [like this](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mercator_projection.png)
or [this](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sea_chase.png) or [this](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sloped_border.png)


## Slide 2: Basics of spatial data 
- What is spatial data? Regular data + spatial component + temporal component (optional) 
Example 1: hv-pylons 
Example 2: fitness data 

Show table with tabular + geo information + temporal information 


## Slide 3: Types of spatial data: 
Raster data vs. vector data 


## Slide 4: Geometric data types

Points, LineStrings, Polygons 

MultiPoints, MultiLineString, Multipolygons 


## Slide 5: Projections and coordinate reference systems

- earth as not a disk, not a sphere, not an ellipsoid, but a geographical potato 
- how projections work: show most common projections: Mercator, UN projection, 
- coordinate reference systems: lat-lon, utm, w3w (RWE-stadium)
- advantages and disadvantages of planar coordinate systems


## Slide 6: Data sources

- internal sources
- OpenData Initiative 
- OSM 
- 

## Slide 7: Spatial data wrangling 
- Postgis: Extension of Postgres 
- Spatial functions 


## Slide 8: Spatial indices: 
- Bread and butter of spatial analysis 
- High level overview of how it works 
- Neighbor searches and spatial joins 

## Slide 9: Use cases

- Which substations are at risk of flooding? 

- Which soccer stadiums have the most amount of pubs within 1 km of the stadium that are not part of the stadium itself? 

- Which houses get served by which fire station? 

- Spatial clustering in real time
